                            How We Use Your Personal Data
                            The legal basis for processing your personal data
                            <br/><br/>
                            We will only collect and process your personal data where we have a legal basis to do so. As a data controller, the legal basis for our collection and use of your personal data varies depending on the manner and purpose for which we collected it. We will only collect personal data from you when:
                            <br/><br/>
                            we have your consent to do so, or
                            we need your personal data to perform a contract with you. For example, to provide you with our service to you, or
                            pursuing our legitimate interests in a way that you might reasonably expect to be a part of running our business and that does not significantly impact your interests, rights and freedoms, for example, showing Honeypot Dating Limited advertisements to you as you browse the internet.
                            we have a legal obligation to collect or disclose personal data from you (e.g. in suspected instances of fraud where we need to give personal data to the National Crime Agency (NCA) or a government body).
                            This is why we process your personal data:
                            For ID and KYC verification purposes
                            Set up a user account
                            Provide, operate and maintain our services
                            Process and complete transactions, and send related information, including transaction confirmations and invoices
                            Manage our customers’ use of our services, respond to enquiries and comments and provide customer service and support;
                            Send customers technical alerts, updates, security notifications, and administrative communications
                            Investigate and prevent fraudulent activities, unauthorised access to our services, and other illegal activities; and
                            For any other purposes about which we notify customers and users.
                            We use your Personal Information in this context based on the contract that we have in place with you or our legitimate interest for security purposes (e.g. the prevention and investigation of fraudulent activities). Personal Information will be deleted based on the terms of the contract.
                            How We Share Your Data
